# Route_planner

In addition to navigating, Autonomous Vehicles may encounter other challenges. For instance, the car would need to make a series of maneuvers including a right turn, lane change, and left turn, potentially crossing lanes with oncoming traffic to reach its destination. Alternatively, the car could choose to take a detour if there is an obstacle in the lane it intended to switch to. The process of guiding a car/robot from its starting point to its destination is known as robot motion planning, or route planning.
